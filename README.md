# Analysis of Ride Sharing Data Dataframe
## Overview of the analysis
We were trying to help the company to create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type by using knowledge of Python and Pandas. In the end, we created a ride sharing summary dataframe by citytype and a multiple line chart of total fares for each city type.

### Pyber summary dataframe:
In general, urban had the most drivers and also total rides among the city types, which was probably because people who live in cities tend to call rides more often because of convenience. However, those who live in less prosperous cities tend to drive by themselves and also because they need to spend more to call a cab than those who live in cities. 
- Rural had 125 total rides, suburban had 625 rides, and urban had 1625 rides which was the most among the city types
- Rural had 78 drivers, surburban had 490 drivers, and urban had 2405 drivers which was the most among the city types
- Urban had the most amount of fares which was about $39854
- Urban had the least expensive average fare per ride, which was about $24
- Urban had the least expensive average fare per driver, which was about $16

### Multiple line chart of total fares for each city types:
- Rural, suburban and urban all had an increase around late February and both urban and suburban reached their greatest amount of fares. 
- Urban had a decline in total fares and reached its least amount around late March.
- Suburban had a decline in total fares and reached its least amount around early April.
- Rural had a steady increase in general, and reached its greatest amount in total fares in early April.
